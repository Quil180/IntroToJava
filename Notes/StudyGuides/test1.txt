  - 9 questions total, 48 points total, 50 with extra credit. (9 minutes per question, you'll be good)
  - dont worry about the nitty gritty (as long as it looks good enough logic wise, your good)
    - Ex: you spell print wrong or you miss a semicolon after return.
    - DONT mix up variables tho, and keep variable names unique
      - and keep tabs consistent so, incase you miss a curly brace, you have some leeway.
  - you will not need to use the println function at alllllllll (for your ease of writing, truly another Dencker W)

The following are code tracing::
  question 1 (8 points, 4 calls, 2 points each):
    - given the following the method, what does the call return?? (aka tracing)

  question 2 (6 points, 3 parts, 2 points each):
    - the same as the 1st question, but 2 functions with the same name (but the parameters will be different, aka a different method technically)
    - you may need to call one function to another.

  question 3 (3 points):
    - given the following method, what are the values of the array that is returned.
      - something will be done.
      - to return the array aka, do [#, #, #, #, #, #, #] (make it clear on paper)

Writing Code:
  question 4 (3 points):
    - Know the String Functions.
    - write a line of code that takes in a string and does stuff to it.
      - like how to compare, lowercase and uppercase strings.

  question 5 (3 points):
    - Random integers/numbers
      - know modulus (%), how to add values of an array, how to selectively add stuff.

  question 6 (3 points):
    - Substring. (take a portion of the string out)
      - stringname.substring(start, end); 
      - Substring notes in the test1.java file

  question 7 (5 points):
    - write a method that takes in something and does stuff then returns a value.


Same question asking for 2 related things (collectively 17 points)
  question 8 (7 points):
    - draw a UML diagram of the class with its description

  question 9 (10 points):
    - write a class named something, aka, write what you drew in the diagram.

Question 10 (extra credit, 2 points):
  - same question on all exams
    - What is something academic or non academic you've learned in this class and why?
